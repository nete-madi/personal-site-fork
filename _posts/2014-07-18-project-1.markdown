description: HackDavis is UC Davis's annual collegiate hackathon. In 2019, my team built Davis Displacement Database, a one-stop web application for people in the Yolo County area to find aid. We placed second overall and won Best Environmental Hack. After the hackathon, we rebuilt our project from the ground up, and it is currently live as CareFinder. Our team no longer maintains this project, but it was a great experience nonetheless.
