description: I am developing two mods for the farming sim game <a href=""https://www.stardewvalley.net/> Stardew Valley </a>. One is a mod that adds the crop saffron into the game, and another is a mod that makes rocks and gemstones edible (per <a href="https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues/1174"> this </a> idea in the SDV mod ideas repository). Both mods are still in active development.
