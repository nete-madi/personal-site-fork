description: I used the Discord.js library to write a very simple Discord bot user that could greet users with an @ mention, tell a joke to a user, give a magic 8 ball response, and pick from a list of items. I wanted to write this bot to become more familiar with JavaScript, as well as gain some experience with using an external API. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nete-madi/ultrabot" target="_blank">my GitHub.</a>
