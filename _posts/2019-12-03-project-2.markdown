description: I wrote a very simple dice roller in Python that takes in the type and number of dice you wish to roll, and produces the result. This application was a personal effort to familiarize myself better with Python. I have plans to add a GUI to this application, both of which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nete-madi/" target="_blank">my GitHub.</a>
